My original flashcard website was really bad and honestly programmed quite poorly, so I'm remaking it because I would still appreciate the functionality of a flashcardwebsite. 
For this version, I will hopefully be storing the data a lot neater and it won't be such a pain to change things about the data after it is created. 

There are doubtless some elements of the original that are functional, but I will be mostly starting from scratch.
